# Ambilight developed in Java
 - Currently for programmers only (no GUI)
 - based on Jue for bridge communication - https://github.com/Q42/Jue (alternative switch to hue REST HTTP Api)
 
# My Code
 - Find the ambilight important code in App.java
# What it does
 - Calculating the average colors of your current screen and sending it in RGB to your Philips HUE Bulbs
 - Use any Philips Hue Bulbs (that are connected to your bridge) as expanded colored light
 
# ToDo
 - Userfriendly Java GUI
 - add brightness regulation
